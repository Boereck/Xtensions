== Xtensions Contribution Guide

External contributions in form of pull requests are welcome, if they include sufficient tests 
and documentation (JavaDoc and, if valuable, description to the link:README.adoc[README] or other AsciiDoc documentation). 
Please note that contributions may be rejected if they do not seem beneficial to the project. Please get in touch
beforehand (e.g. via issues) to get to know if a certain enhancement is regarded beneficial. +
Currently there are no preferred labels for the issues, this guide will be updated as soon
as the preferred labels are decided on.

If you contribute code, consider adding yourself to the developers list in the root `pom.xml` file.

Better code examples for the documentation are very welcome 😊.
