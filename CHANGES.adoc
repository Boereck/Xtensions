link:https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/Xtensions/milestone/2?closed=1[Related GitHub issues]

=== Added 

- Bumped Xtend minimum version to `2.13`
- Added `combinations` and `combinationsWith` extension methods for `Iterator` and `Iterable` to generate cartesian products.
- Added `withoutAll` extension methods for `Iterable` and `Iterator` to filter elements from the source available in another `Iterable`.
- Added `partitionBy` extension methods for `Iterator` and `Iterable`, partitioning elements into two aggregates: selected and rejected.
- Added `Iterator`/`Iterable` extension methods `groupIntoListBy` and `groupIntoSetBy` to group elements by given classes.
- Added `into` extension methods to `Iterator`/`Iterable` to add elements to one or more ``Collection``s.
