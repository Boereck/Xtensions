= Development of the Xtensions Library

This chapter gives an overview over how to get stated on development of the Xtensions library.

== Build

The build is based on maven tycho, the wrapper script `mvnw` in the root directory of the repository takes care of the maven installation.
On Linux and Mac you might need to call `chmod +x mvnw`.

To build the libraries from source, simply drop into the root directory and call `mvnw clean package`.
The main library will be located in `bundles/de.fhg.fokus.xtensions/target`

The p2 update site containing the library is located in directory `p2/de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.p2/target/repository`.


== Setting up the Development Environment

The repository contains the Oomph setup file link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraunhoferfokus/Xtensions/master/releng/de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.setup/Xtensions.setup[Xtensions.setup] 
for the Eclipse IDE.

Start the Eclipse installer, then switch to advanced mode (hamburger menu in the top-right corner).
Select the "Eclipse IDE for Java Development" and press "Next >". On the next page press the green
plus button and select the catalog "Github Projects" and paste the URL of the setup file above 
into the "Resource URIs" text field. Then select the checkbox next to the "Xtensions" entry and
press "Next >". Enter the installation details as preferred, press "Next >", then press "Finish". 
The Eclipse IDE will be installed and configured. It may need to restart one ore more times.

== External Contributions

Please have a look at the link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contribution guide].

== Performing a Release

Releasing a new version of the Xtensions library is mostly automated. To trigger a 
release, a new tag has to be created in the GitHub project. This tag *must* be a 
valid sem-ver version number `major.minor.patch`.

Here is a checklist of steps to perform (in this order):

[ ] Update the version of root `pom.xml` (keep the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix, it will be removed during the build)
[ ] Update the version of every bundle and feature project (see folders `bundles`, `features`, `tests`, `bundles-incubation`, and `tests-incubation`)
[ ] Adjust the `.travis/bintray-deploy.json` file declaring the new version
[ ] Update the `README.adoc` file
[ ] Create/push the tag of the new version number
[ ] Check if p2 deployment to bintray worked
[ ] Log into bintray to promote the release to maven central
