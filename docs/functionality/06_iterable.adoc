== Extensions to Iterable

The `de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.IterableExtensions` class provides extension methods to 
`java.lang.Iterable`

Unfortunately the `java.lang.Iterable` interface does not provide a (default)
method for creating a `java.lang.Stream`. It does provide a method to obtain a 
`Spliterator` which can be used to create a stream, but this is rather unpleasant to use. +
The `IterableExtensions` class provides the `stream` extension method to easily create
a stream from an iterable. This method will first check if the given iterable is instance of
`java.util.Collection`, since this class does provide a default `stream` method,
otherwise it will construct a stream from the spliterator provided by the iterable.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.IterableExtensions.*
import java.util.OptionalDouble
//...
#["foo", null, "BAR", "bazzzz"]
	.filterNull
	.averageSize
	.ifPresent [
		println('''The average string lenght is «it»''')
	]

//...

private def OptionalDouble averageSize(Iterable<String> strings) {
	strings.stream.mapToInt[length].average // <1>
}
----
<1> In this line the extension method `stream` is called on the iterable `strings`.

Analogous to the `stream` method the `IterableExtensions` class also provides a `parallelStream` method.

It is also possible to map an iterable to a primitive iterable 
(see <<08_primitive_iterables#from-iterables,Primitve Iterables / From Iterables>>).


The JDK since Java 8 provides the class `java.util.stream.Collector` which can be used with streams
to perform a reduction operation over all elements in a stream. The class `java.util.stream.Collectors`
already provides constructor methods for a bunch of useful collectors. The `IterableExtensions` class
of this library provides a `collect` extension method directly for `Iterable` to easily reduce the elements
of the iterable.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.IterableExtensions.*
// ...
val Iterable<String> strings = #["fooooo", "baar", "baz"]
val summary = strings.collect(summarizingInt[length])
println("Average length: " + summary.average)
println("Max length: " + summary.max)
----


A fairly common task in Model-to-Model transformations is to find objects of one type that are not referenced by 
some other objects. This is usually done by navigation over all elements in a model, finding all elements of both
types and then finding the elements that are actually not referenced. This is typically done by traversing the 
complete model twice to find the elements of both types. This can be an expensive operation if the input model
is large. The solution is to traverse the model just once and group the elements according to their type.

This library provides a method allowing exactly this. The method `groupIntoListBy` and `groupIntoSetBy`
groups elements of an iterable by their type.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
val foo = "foo"
val bar = "bar"
val baz = "baz"
val traverseMe = #[foo, #[bar], baz, #[foo], bar]
val groups = traverseMe.groupIntoSetBy(String, List)

val Set<String> strings = groups.get(String)
val Set<List> lists = groups.get(List)
val inNoList = strings
	.filter[str| 
		!lists.exists[it.contains(str)]
	].toList
println("Elements contained in no list: " + inNoList)
----


To exclude elements of one `Iterable` from another, the method `withoutAll` can be used.
[source,xtend]
----
val s = #["I", "boo", "pity", "char", "the", "fool"]
	.withoutAll(#{"boo", "char"})
	.join(" ")
println(s)
----

CAUTION: Performance of `withoutAll` is best when using an appropriate `java.util.Set`, such as `HashSet` for the elements to exclude.

To partition the elements of an `Iterable` based on a predicate or the class (elements are tested to be instance of) into two parts: 
selected and rejected. The selected part will contain the elements for which the predicate evaluates to `true` or elements are instance 
of the given partitioning class. The rejected part will contain the other elements. 

Example:


[source,xtend]
----
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.IterableExtensions.*
// ...
val char[] chars = #[0x0020 as char, 0x0034 as char]
val List<CharSequence> list = #[
	"Hello", 
	new StringBuilder().append(chars), 
	"Xtend", 
	new StringBuilder().append(0x0032 as char)
]
list.partitionBy(String) => [
	println('''Selected: "«selected.join(" ")»"''')	
	println('''Rejected: "«rejected.join("")»"''')
]
---- 

For both versions of the `partitionBy` method there exist overloads that take instances of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html[`Collector`].

Example:


[source,xtend]
----
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.IterableExtensions.*
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*
import java.util.Set
import java.util.List
// ...
val list = #["foo", "bla", "foo", "hui", "fun"]
val partition = list.partitionBy([startsWith("f")], toSet, toList)
val Set<String> selected = partition.selected
val List<String> rejected = partition.rejected
println("Unique words starting with 'f' : " + selected.join(", "))
println("Other words: " + rejected.join(", "))
---- 


Note that the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#partitioningBy-java.util.function.Predicate-[`Collectors#partitioningBy`] Collector from the JDK aggregates into a `Map<Boolean,List<T>>` where `T` is the type of the elements in a collected stream. Another https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#partitioningBy-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.stream.Collector-[`partitioningBy`] overload from `Collectors` aggregates the map values and returns a `Map<Boolean,D>` where `D` is the aggregation of a "downstream" `Collector`. 


[source,xtend]
----
val list = #["foo", "bla", "foo", "hui", "fun"]
val partition = list.partitionBy([startsWith("f")], Collectors::toSet, Collectors::toList)
val Set<String> selected = partition.selected
val List<String> rejected = partition.rejected
println("Unique words starting with 'f' : " + selected.join(", "))
println("Other words: " + rejected.join(", "))
---- 

To allow a similar workflow to the JDK version, for the `Partition` of this library a `asMap` extension method is provided 
for `Partitions` having the same type for the selected and rejected part. The other way around an extension method is provided 
to wrap a `Map<Boolean,X>` into a `Partition<X,X>`.


To add elements from an `Iterable` to one or more collections, the `into` extension method is provided by the class `IterableExtensions`.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
val namesWithB = newArrayList("Barbara", "Bob", "Brian")
val newNames = #["Justin", "Anna", "Bruce", "Chris", "Becky"]
newNames
	.filter[it.toFirstLower.startsWith("b")]
	.into(namesWithB)

namesWithB.forEach[
	println(it)
]
