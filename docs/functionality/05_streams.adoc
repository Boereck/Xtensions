== Extensions to Streams

The class `de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions` provides extension
methods to the `java.util.stream.Stream` interface.

Java 8 streams are missing a few methods known from the Xtend iterable extension methods.
The one method that is probably most often used is the method to filter by type. This can easily
be retrofitted on the Streams API by an extension method. This extension method is provided
in the `StreamExtensions` class.

Example: 


[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
val s = Stream.of(42, "Hello", Double.NaN, "World")
	.filter(String)
	.collect(Collectors.joining(" "))
----

TIP: Since joining Strings is a common operation, the `StringStreamExtensions` allow to call `join`
directly on the Stream. Have a look at [Extensions to Streams of Strings].

Some other collectors, especially the ones bridging to the collections API are also used very often,
but using the collect method with the methods from the `Collectors` class is a bit verbose. +
As a shortcut the `StreamExtensions` class provides `toList`, `toSet`, and `toCollection` 
extension methods to the `Stream` class.

Example:


[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
val list = Stream.of("Foo", "Hello" , "Boo", "World")
	.filter[!contains("oo")]
	.map[toUpperCase]
	.toList
----

A useful extension method from Xtend on `java.lang.Iterable` is the `filterNull` method, which
produces a view for an iterable excluding the `null` elements. An equivalent is not provided on the 
`Stream` interface. This library provides such an extension method on stream.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
Stream.of(42.0, null, "foo", 100_000_000_000bi)
	.filterNull
	.forEach [
		// it is guaranteed to be != null 
		println(it.toString.toUpperCase)
	]
----


As a shortcut for the 
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#concat-java.util.stream.Stream-java.util.stream.Stream-[concat]
method the `StreamExtensions` class provides a `+` operator.


The `flatMap` method on `Stream` expects a function mapping to another stream. Oftentimes data structures
do not provide streams, but `Collection` or `Iterable` types, so the user has to create a stream based on
them. This usually leads to some visual noise. This library provides a `flatMap` extension method which allows to 
be called with a function providing an iterable, since it is known how to construct a stream from an iterable.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotations.Accessors
import org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotations.FinalFieldsConstructor
import java.util.stream.Stream
import java.util.function.Function
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
val stream = Stream.of(
	new Developer("Max", #{"Java", "Xtend", "Rust", "C++"}), 
	new Developer("Joe", #{"Xtend", "JavaScript", "Dart"}) 
);

// Mapping language name to number of occurrences
val Map<String, Long> langPopularity = stream
	.flatMap[languages] // <1>
	.collect(groupingBy(Function.identity, counting))

langPopularity.entrySet
	.stream
	.max(Map.Entry.comparingByValue)
	.ifPresent [
		println('''Most pobular language: «it.key», count: «it.value»''')
	]

// ...

@FinalFieldsConstructor
@Accessors
static class Developer {
	val String name
	val Set<String> languages;
}
----
<1> Here `languages` can be returned directly instead of `languages.stream`

Sometimes it is interesting to produce the cartesian product of two containers of elements. To produce 
all combinations of the elements of a stream with the elements of an `Iterable` (or a different source 
of a stream) this library provides the `combinations` extension methods. If no merging function is 
provided, the `combinations` extension methods will create a `org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib.Pair` 
object for each combination. If a merging function is provided, the resulting stream will hold the result 
of the merge of each combination.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
Stream.of("foo", "bar")
	.combinations(#["fun", "boo", "faz"])[a,b|a+b]
	.forEach[
		println(it)
	]
----


Java 9 provides a static factory methods for an infinite stream 
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#iterate-T-java.util.function.UnaryOperator-[Stream.iterate(T,UnaryOperator<T>)]. A function with the same functionality is provided via `StreamExtensions`. 
There is even an overloaded version of the static method that can be written as if the method would exist in the Stream class:


[source,xtend]
----
// This is using Java 8
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StreamExtensions.*
// ...
Stream.iterate("na ")[it + it]
	.filter[length > 15]
	.findFirst
	.ifPresent [
		println(it + "Batman!")
	]
----

This method can be handy traversing a nested data structure of same-type elements (e.g. moving up a containment hierarchy).

== Extensions to Streams of Strings

Since Xtend can provide extension methods specifically for specializations of generic types,
it is possible to provide methods only available for `java.util.stream.Stream<String>`.
The class `de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions` provides such extension methods.

The most used collectors on streams of strings are the joining collectors from `java.util.stream.Collectors`.
To make these easy to use `join` methods have been introduced as extension methods to `Stream<String>`.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions.*
// ...
val joined = Stream.of("Hello", "Xtend", "aficionados").join(" ")
println(joined)
----


Another operation often performed on streams of strings is filtering it based on a regular expression.
This is provided via the extension method `matching`. The pattern can either be passed in as string
or as a pre-compiled `java.util.regex.Pattern`

Example:


[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions.*
// ...
Stream.of("foo", "bar", "kazoo", "baz", "oomph", "shoot")
	.matching(".+oo.*")
	.forEach [
		println(it)
	]
----


When splitting strings provided as a stream it is handy to get an operation providing a single
stream of the result of splitting all elements, which also works as lazy as possible. A use case
would be to to use http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#lines-java.nio.file.Path-[Files.lines(Path)]
and then split the resulting lines of this operation.

Example:

[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions.*
// ...
Stream.of("Hello users", "welcome to this demo", "hope it helps")
	.flatSplit("\\s+")
	.forEach [
		println(it)
	]
----

Sometimes it is also wanted to find all matches of a regular expressions in a stream of strings and
produce a single stream of all the matches in all strings. This can be done using the `flatMatches`
extension method. The pattern of the regular expression can either be provided as a string or as a 
pre-compiled `java.util.regex.Pattern` object.

Example:


[source,xtend]
----
import java.util.regex.Pattern
import java.util.stream.Stream
import static extension de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions.*
// ...
val Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(\\woo)")		
Stream.of("Welcome to the zoo", "Where cows do moo", "And all animals poo")
	.flatMatches(pattern)
	.forEach [
		println(it)
	]
----
