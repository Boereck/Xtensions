This library is mainly a collection of https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/[Xtend] extension methods
for classes in the Java 8 standard library and the Xtend standard library. A few goals are:

* Adding extension methods to Java 8 JDK types to make them work more naturally with Xtend
* Making a select few Java 9 methods available on Java 8
* Providing support for iteration over primitive values without resort to boxing
* Adding some useful additional methods to existing standard JDK and Xtend standard lib classes

Note that the policy of using functional interfaces is the following:

* Generally, the Xtend interfaces defined in http://javadoc.io/page/org.eclipse.xtext/org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib/latest/org/eclipse/xtext/xbase/lib/Functions.html[`org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib.Functions`] 
  are preferred over the ones defined in JDK 8 package.
  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/function/package-summary.html[`java.util.function`]
* When primitive values are involved, the specialized interfaces from `java.util.function` are preferred.
* When a shim over JDK 8 APIs is provided and Xtend interfaces would introduce unnecessary object allocations
  the JDK interfaces are preferred.

== Usage

In the following, we will show how to add the Xtensions library to your build.

=== Current Release

If you are using Eclipse or a Maven Tycho build, you can use the p2 repository 
`https://dl.bintray.com/boereck/xtensions-p2/Xtensions/1.0.0/`. 
Here is the repository info you can add to your maven `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>xtensions-p2</id>
		<layout>p2</layout>
		<url>https://dl.bintray.com/boereck/xtensions-p2/Xtensions/1.0.0/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

If you use a regular Maven build, simply add the following dependency. The library was added
to maven central.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.github.fraunhoferfokus.xtensions</groupId>
		<artifactId>de.fhg.fokus.xtensions</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

If you are using gradle, add the following dependency:

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.github.fraunhoferfokus.xtensions:de.fhg.fokus.xtensions:1.0.0'
----

=== Using Snapshot Releases

Please add the following repository to your maven pom:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jfrog-snapshots</id>
		<url>http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

Then add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.github.fraunhoferfokus.xtensions</groupId>
		<artifactId>de.fhg.fokus.xtensions</artifactId>
		<version>1.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies> 
---- 

When using gradle, add the repository like this:

[source,gradle]
----
  repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/"
        }
    }
----

And add the following dependency:

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.github.fraunhoferfokus.xtensions:de.fhg.fokus.xtensions:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
----


Currently there is no snapshot p2 update site, we hope to provide this shortly. +
Please have a look at the link:./docs/development.adoc[Build] section if you want to build the library from source on your own.


== Functionality and APIs

Most of the functionality provided by the library is described in a GitBook, based on the documentation files in this repository.
The book is made available link:https://boereck.gitbooks.io/xtensions[here].

An overview over the documentation files can be viewed directly on GitHub link:https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/Xtensions/blob/master/SUMMARY.adoc[here]. 
GitHub has better code highlighting for Xtend snippets, so you might prefer this.

JavaDocs are currently not provided, but once released, a link to the respective javadoc.io site will be added.


== Development on the Library

Please have a look at the link:./docs/development.adoc[Development] document on how to get started with the development on the library
and some notes on contributing to the Xtensions project.
